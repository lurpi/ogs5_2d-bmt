# ogs5_2d-bmt
BMT for decovalex 2019, 2d formulation

Injection into fracture embedded in imperveable rock mass

Initial pressure 0.5 MPa, injection pressure 1 MPa

BMT1: rigid fracture, constant permeability, storage due to fluid compressibility only; 

BMT2: stiff fracture (20 GPa/m), constant permeability, storage due to fluid and fracture;

BMT3:  stiff fracture (20 GPa/m), permeability varying with fracture opening, storage due to fluid and fracture.
